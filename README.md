Cat clicker
===========

Cat cliker is one of the [Udacity Javascript Design Patterns](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989) course project.
It does absolutely nothing useful, unless allows you to choose a cat and do some clicks on it.
Well ok, it will count the number of clicks for you, that's all.

Also it's my attempt to play with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) technologies.

Installation
------------
```bash
npm install
```

Building
--------
```bash
webpack
```

It will build project and put all files to ```dist/``` directory

Development mode
----------------
```bash
webpack-dev-server --progress --content-base dist/
```
